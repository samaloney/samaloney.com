I am a research fellow working in solar physics with interests in blah. I originally studied experimental physics at [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie) with a heavy emphasis on mathematics and computer science. I received my PhD from [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie) studying Coronal Mass Ejections using the twin vantage points of [NASA's STEREO Spacecraft](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stereo/main/index.html). After obtaining my PhD I decided to take a break from academia and took on a role as a software engineer at [Skytek](https://www.skytek.com) where I worked on various projects in the aerospace and security sectors before returning a research role. I currently work on solar flares, using X-ray and gamma-ray imaging observations to understand the process that govern these massive releases of energy. I am part of the [STIX](http://stix.i4ds.ch/mission/obtaining-data/) team, STIX is one of the 10 instruments making up [ESA Solar Orbiter mission](http://sci.esa.int/solar-orbiter/) due for launch in 2019. Solar Orbiter will fly inside the orbit of Mercury and leave the ecliptic producing some novel observations and furthering our understanding of the Sun, our nearest Start, and its effect on us.

Current Interests
-----------------
**STIX (Spectrometer / Telescope for Imaging X-Rays)** As part of the STIX team I am involved in number of aspects the project. Developing the software other researchers will use to analyse the data returned from STIX and the data archive. During the cruise phase STIX will return data 


**Image Reconstruction** X-ray telescopes are not like traditional telescopes as X-rays are difficult to focus and detect. X-ray telescopes use a technique known as Fourier imaging where the images are not directly recorded but only certain  Fourier components are, the transformation of these components back into images poses some interesting challenges. Numerous algorithms have been developed or adapted from the closely related field of radio interferometry 

**Machine Learning** Astrophysics in general and in particular solar physics is acquiring vast amounts of observations that no human could ever hope to analyse. For examples [SDO] generates around 1.4 TB of data per day, when DKIST is  .As such automated methods must be developed to help process, tag, and flag all these observation.
